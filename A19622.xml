            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

many of you, namely, how theſe our enemies moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
and in warlike maner, with Enſignes diſplayed, in

firſt made, according to the lawes of Armes, haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into our territories and countrey, burned ſome of
our Churches, defaced the auncient monuments of our
elders, put multitudes of her Maieſties people to the
ſword, yea women and children, waſted their dwellings
with fire, deſpoiled them of their goods, and rauiſhed
moſt ſhamefully their wiues, daughters &amp; kinſwomen,
euen afore their faces: to be ſhort, there is no cruelty or
tyrannie whatſoeuer which might be deuiſed, but they
haue afflicted her Highneſſe ſubiects therewith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to our nation hath bene alwayes moſt odious, in that it
hath bin accounted valorous in armes in all countries,
as one writeth:
<q>Anglia Bistonio gens ſemper inclita Marte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Euerie man is borne once to die, and how, when, or
where, is moſt vncertaine: and to giue our liues for our

the heathen) bene reputed an honorable thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
euerlaſting fame is attained, and left to poſteritie as
the noble Orator <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith: <hi>Hijs maiores noſtri, qui ob rem

are both dead, if there be no vertues or deedes of fame
done by them, whereby to commend their name to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.
Therefore euerie man that deſireth to liue in
name when he is dead, ought to endeuour himſelfe to
leaue ſome memorie of his vertues or worthie acts, that
it may appeare that once he liued here, elſe being laid
in his graue, he ſhall ſoone be forgotten. Riches and
beautie (ſaith <hi>Saluſt</hi>) do vaniſh ſoone away, but vertues
and deeds of fame are euerlaſting: which ſith our liues

If you will conſider what miſeries and calamities hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

greeuous taxes, tallages and impoſitions, vpon our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
There was no cruelty, no miſery, no ſeruitude or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
which could be deuiſed, but he afflicted them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
as by our Chronicles euidently appeareth: and ſhall
we looke for any other if our enemies ſhoulde preuaile?

a ſmall Army of Englishmen, paſſed in deſpite of them

and 60000. of the braueſt fighting men in Spaine,
&amp; erected in his place Don Pedro their lawful Prince, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And for that praiſe and rewards are due for iuſt deſerts,
if you will ſhew your ſelues valiant Captains and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſouldiors in this ſeruice, of which I haue no doubt, and
wherof I wil (God willing) make true report vnto her Ma.
you may be aſſuted, that as ſhe wil highly commend you,

you to be the chiefe defenders of her ſtate and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
againſt the enemy, and regardeth not ſuch as liue
daintily &amp; at eaſe before men of your quality: For they (as
Oſorius affirmeth) which prefer ſuch before men of your
condition, are to be held ſubuerters of their countrey, in
laying it open to the enemy, &amp; in defrauding the ſame of
her neceſſary defence &amp; ſafeguard. And for my part I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you on my Honor, that whatſoeuer perſons you ſhall
take priſoners, &amp; whatſoeuer thing ſhall fal into your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of the ſpoile (after the battel) you ſhal enioy the ſame with
good wil, as the law of Armes requireth: to the end ye may
the rather be incouraged in this action now in hand: for I
hold it no reaſon that you ſhould abide the brunt of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and not retaine and enioy the ſame which you ſhall
obtaine with the venturing of your liues and loſſe of your
bloud. And againe, the rather to encourage you in this
ſeruice, ſee how gratiouſlie and carefully her Ma. and the
<pb facs="tcp:5439:7"/>
whole ſtate of the Parliament haue prouided for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and releefe of ſuch of you which bee common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which ſhal happen to be maimed in her wars, which
afore her daies was neuer done.</p>
            <p>And now to the end we may the rather preuaile againſt
our enemies, I exhort and aduiſe you (noble Captains &amp;
valiant Gentlemen) attempt nothing in your fury without
due conſideration firſt had, for ſuch enterpriſes are not
holden to proceede of courage and valour, but rather of
raſhneſſe, which often bringeth danger to the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
And you couragious ſouldiors, ſubmit your ſelues to
the order and direction of your chieftaines and leaders, of
whoſe great experience and skill in martiall affaires, you
ſhall not need to doubt, by reaſon of their continuall trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp therin: and ſo much the rather you muſt thus do,
becauſe you are not yet ſuch men of vnderſtanding in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
diſcipline:<note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> So did the noble Graecians as Herodotus
writeth, whereby ſmall companies gaue ſundry notable
ouerthrowes to great multitudes of the Perſians in battel,
euen when they were in their chiefeſt conqueſts, &amp; moſte
triumphed of their glorious victories. Where no order is
(the ſcripture ſaieth) there is confuſion and vtter ruine.
Keepe therefore your rankes, break not your arraies, ſtand
faſt in your places to which you are appointed; for out of
doubt as obſeruation of orders in battell is neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of victory, ſo doth diſorder open the way to the
enimy to ouerthrow you. If you keepe order you ſhall be
euen like a ſtrong Bulwarke againſt the enimie, which
they will with all their forces attempt to breake, being the
only way to gaine them victorie: of which purpoſe if they
faile, then they will bee vtterly diſcomfited and fall into
<pb facs="tcp:5439:7"/>
your hands. To conclude, forſomuch as the chance of war
is vncertaine, and the ſequele therof ſtandeth doubtful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the cauſes afore remembred, ought greatly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
you in this ſeruice, and to hope of victory: yet let
vs all make our ſelues readie for whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe
God to lay vpon vs, and let vs make our humble prayers to
Almighty God, confeſſing our ſinnefull liues, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

And likewiſe, if a man that is vnfit in his owne perſon for

might be maintained: or that if any of the Courtiers hauing

that it is not the great multitude of men of war, horſes, &amp;

is called the lord of hoſtes, who euer fighteth for his owne

               <p>Theſe are left to vs for examples, that we ſhould not put

is no king that can bee ſaued by the multitude of an hoaſt,
neither is any mightie man deliuered by much ſtrength. A

he deliuer any man by his great ſtrength. Behold the cie of

               <p>Now therefore conſidering theſe miſeries and calamities,

We ſhall be ſlaine as thicke as motes in the ſun,
our fathers, mothers, wiues, children, kinſfolkes and allies,

               <p>And for ſome among many examples of the loyaltie of

for a full teſtimony and declaration of his truth to his

not ſtaine his bloud in ioyning with a ſort of rebels and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

faithfully did the Lord <hi>George</hi> laſt Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the great truſt repoſed in him by her Maieſtie and her
whole Councell, in the garding &amp; ſafe keeping of the Quéene

of ſuch importance, as the like ſo long time was neuer

deuiſes and ſubtill practiſes wrought by her ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for her eſcape, it is ſufficiently knowne. The truſt was
the greater, for that if ſhe had eſcaped, no ſmall danger might
haue enſued to the perſon of our moſt gracious Queene, and
to the whole Realme, as may appeare by her ſundry conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies

made Lieutenant of the counties of <hi>Darby</hi> and <hi>Stafford</hi> in
thoſe dangerous dayes, and how he performed the ſame truſt
to the preſeruation of the common peace and quietneſſe of

was committed to himſelfe alſo, when he had authority in
times of rebellion and other outrageous actions in thoſe
parts to ſuppreſſe the ſame in forcible manner, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

valiant, yet they accompt you as traytors to your Prince

diſdaine you: and how hardly you haue bene dealt withall
there, your owne experience telleth you, which in the booke
of the ſtate of Engliſh fugitiues is ſet downe at large. I will
remember ſome: When the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> lay in ſiege at
<hi>Andenard,</hi> did not <hi>Norris, Barney, Corniſh,</hi> and <hi>Gibſon</hi> (whom
they had choſen to be their Captaines) with a troupe of ſixe
hundreth Engliſhmen, the talleſt &amp; beſt appointed ſouldiers
<pb facs="tcp:5439:30"/>
that a man might lightly ſee, offer their ſeruice to the ſayd
Duke, their comming being the onely cauſe that the ſayd
towne (a matter of great importance, and on the land ſide as
it were the key of the prouince of <hi>Flaunders</hi>) was ſo ſoone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vnto him as it was: for whereas the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> lay vnder the walles of <hi>Gaunt</hi> with
ſufficient force and deliberate reſolution to ſuccour the ſayd
towne of <hi>Andenard</hi> (vpon this mutinie of the Engliſh) they
marched away with their whole army, leauing the enemy
battering the ſayd towne, which ſeeing it ſelfe fruſtrated of
the expected ſuccors, preſently rendered it ſelfe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke
of <hi>Parma:</hi> thence they were drawne to <hi>Winoch Bargen,</hi> to
ſerue againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French &amp; Engliſh, which lay there incamped,
where they behaued themſelues with ſuch deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that day, that <hi>Monſieur de Balaunſon</hi> brother to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Waranbone</hi> was taken priſoner, that beſides the loſſe
of many of their liues, they were in this action a wonder to
the whole army. But could the pride of the Spaniard endure
to heare theſe your prayſes, nay did not they enuie and
greatly diſdaine it,<note place="margin">They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine you.</note> ſaying: That you had ſerued rather like
gyddy headed drunkards then men wiſe and valiant. For
a further proofe of valour, ſhortly after vppon the remoue of
the Duke of <hi>Alanſons</hi> army towards <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the reſt of them
were likewiſe brought thither, where alſo they gaue excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
teſtimony of their valour and courage, namely the very
day that <hi>Sir Iohn Norris</hi> made that famous retraite before
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> who when the Frenchmen fled with a diſordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
did with a preſent courage and excellent directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
maintaine the place with ſuch regiments of Engliſhmen, as
were vnder his charge, and withſtanding the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
with all his puiſſance, who furiouſly charged him, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
withdrew his men, ſtill holding their pikes in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes
of their enemies vnder the walles of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exceeding damage to the enemy, beſides diuerſe other
great ſeruices done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd king in the field. But how were
they recompenced for the ſame? were not a great number of
<pb facs="tcp:5439:31"/>
them ſuffered to periſh in maner for hunger, &amp; could neither
get meat, nor their pay, to prouide for their néed: whereupon
ſome of them were conſtrained by foraging in the country to
relieue their hunger, and were not foure and twentie of them
taken by the Spaniſh Prouoſt, and caried to <hi>Andenard,</hi> of the
rendring whereof they had bene the chiefeſt meane, &amp; there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in the market place? And was not another troope
of them being thirty in number in a village neare <hi>Papering</hi> in
<hi>Flaunders,</hi> by a company of the Spaniards, after a friendly &amp;
ſouldierlike ſalutation of each ſide,<note place="margin">Engliſhmen murthered moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> as they were all making
merrie together, on a ſudden taken at aduantage, and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and moſt treacherouſly, cowardly, and inhumanely mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
euerie one? whereof, though ſundrie complaints were
made to the Duke by their friends that were thus murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and by their Captaines, yet Spaniards being the doers
thereof, there could be no remedy nor iuſtice obtained. But to
make them amends, becauſe they wold be the cleanlier rid of
the reſidue of this miſerable troope, the Campe being then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Winoch Bargen,</hi> wherein lay a migty ſtrong garriſon of
Frenchmen, they made them two Forts of purpoſe, in which
they willingly placed the Engliſh in the vttermoſt part of
the whole Campe, &amp; neareſt confining to the towne, to the end
they might haue all their throats cut (as indéed they had in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
few nights after) at which time the enemie aſſaulting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with great furie, and they defending themſelues moſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
aboue the ſpace of one houre, in ſuch ſort as the Alarum
paſſed through the whole Campe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they were not relieued
with any ſuccour at all, inſomuch as the greateſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
being ſlaine, the enemie at laſt entred, and put the reſidue to
the ſword. To rehearſe the ſundry and ſeuerall calamities
that theſe poore men, aſwel Captaines as ſouldiers endured,
during the time of their vnfortunate ſeruice, eſpecially at
<hi>Gansbecke, Aske</hi> and <hi>Gauer,</hi> would ſéeme for the vnſpeakeable
ſtrangeneſſe therof, ſcarcely credible, for they neuer receiued
in all the time of their ſeruice one moneths pay, their Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
and their Enſignes haue bene ſéene to go vp and
<pb facs="tcp:5439:31"/>
downe ſickely and famiſhed, begging their bread, couered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with poore blankets and tickes of featherbeds, that they had
rifled in the villages abroad. And for a further proofe of the
cruelty of the Spaniards againſt the Engliſh nation, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the fortune of warres hath deliuered any of vs into
their hands, it is ſtrange to thinke with what gréedie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
thirſt, they haue deſired to ſhed the Engliſh bloud.
And for examples, at <hi>Reſendale,</hi> where ſundrie Engliſh regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
being by the Marſhal <hi>Byron</hi> abandoned and betrayed,
were by them defeated and ouerthrowne as is ſcarcely credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
what barbarous crueltie they vſed vpon men rendred
and demanding mercie vpon their knées. But admit all cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tolerable during the ſurie of an execution (though amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
Chriſtians, and men of noble and valorous minds, there is
yet a moderation to be vſed) what bloudy inhumanitie was
euer heard the like to that which they vſed the next day: for
wheras the <hi>Italians</hi> &amp; <hi>Burgonians</hi> (moued with a ſouldier like
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion) had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many Engliſh priſoners,<note place="margin">A horrible murther of the Engliſh men by Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards after they were yeelded.</note> &amp; ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from

brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth, thinking to leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quietly to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
did not the Spaniards with a helliſh furie, crying <hi>matta,

wounds theſe poore naked men, not ſuffering a man of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to

enery one? They wil not truſt you (neither is there any reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the Earle of <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> who vpon their humble requeſt

and yet they would not truſt him, but appointed one <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
a Spaniard to be ioyned with him, as his aſſiſtant, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Maiſter or Commander both ouer him and the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of them ſtanding together, ſéeing certaine Engliſhmen
paſſe by, one of them ſayd, that he wondred what the King
made with anie ſuch vermine in his countrey. Another of
them ſware a great oath, that looke how manie Engliſhmen
there were in the kings ſeruice, there were ſo many ſpies &amp;
traitors. The third ſaid, it was an almes déed to put them all
in ſackes, and throw them into the riuer. And the fourth
ſaid, it would be a better courſe to ſend them to the kings gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
where in regard of their big ioints and broad ſhoulders
they could not but proue good to tug at an oare. A great ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
that countrey ſware by a great oth, that he knew not any one
of the Engliſh in regard of his ability, fit to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſeruice
worth the ſtraw that lay vnder his foot. Another great man of
that country ſaid, that he did not know what ſeruice the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
had done, or were able to do, vnleſſe it were to ſpend the
kings money in tauernes and brothell houſes.</p>
               <p>They ſought to diſgrace you: for whereas ſome of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Captaines had made of their owne charges new &amp; faire
Enſignes, thoſe Enſignes were by a Spaniſh Commiſſarie
called <hi>Spinoſa</hi> (who came with order to diſſolue the regiment)
taken violently from thoſe that bare them, in preſence of the
Earle of <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> who was Coronell of the regiment:
&amp; for a greater diſgrace both to him &amp; the reſt, though both he,
Captaine <hi>Treſham,</hi> &amp; the other Captaines complained to the
Duke for redreſſe, yet they could not obtaine any: the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
after wards made his brags, that he turned the Engliſh
Enſignes into Spaniſh field beds.</p>
               <p>They count you but traitors for conſpiring the ouerthrow
of your Prince and countrey, and ſo they may well do,
and ſo they do all ſuch as contrarie to the truſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repoſed

the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> for 30000 French crownes: which ſeruice,
how beneficiall and meritorious it was to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſuch
as know the countrey can teſtifie ſufficiently: for by yéelding
of the ſayd towne, they were the occaſion that they got <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounde,</hi>
the <hi>Saſſe,</hi> the fort of <hi>Leyskins, Hooke, S. Anthonies,</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

whoſe reuengefull iuſtice neuer ceaſed to purſue the infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of thoſe miſerable men, vntill he had taken them from the

reſt, after hee had conſidered of the foulneſſe of his fact, and
withall did ſee the ſcorne and contempt wherein hee liued
vnder the Spaniard, it wrought ſuch an impreſſion in his
hart, that hee fell into a kind of lunacy, being in priſon in
<hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and in the ende ended there his life with his owne
hand: <hi>Gibſon</hi> riſing out of his bed ſuddenly (being in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
naked) was by a Spaniſh horſeman preſently thruſt
<pb facs="tcp:5439:33"/>
through the body and ſo died, whoſe wife ſued to the Duke
of <hi>Parma</hi> for iuſtice, but the Engliſh bloud was there of ſuch
vile price being ſhed by a Spaniard, that the matter was
thought not worthy to be inquired of. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was in one of
the ſayd little forts at ſuch time as it was ſurpriſed by the
Frenchmen, where both himſelfe, his Lieutenant, his

mangled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barners</hi> was ſhot through the right arme by a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
with a ſmall ſhot, in ſuch ſort that he hath vtterly
loſt the vſe thereof, and after liued in great miſery and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty:
ſuch (after theſe mens ſeruices) was their fortune, &amp;
ſuch is the ende of all trecherous and euill affected Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

               <p>
                  <hi>Pygot</hi> died ſuddenly in the Marſhalſey at London, being
ſent thither as priſoner from <hi>Oſtend. Daulcon</hi> became a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

Captaine <hi>Welch</hi> was ſlaine vnder the walles of <hi>Roane,
Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> were executed at Tyburne. Thus you
haue heard what it is to liue vnder, and ſerue a forreyne
Prince. They truſt you not, for how can a ſtrange Prince
in reaſon perſwade himſelfe, that ſuch as are traitours, and in
their actions monſters againſt their countrey, will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, but will alwayes carry a iealous opinion ouer
you: that he will neuer credit you with any ſeruice of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but when he will appoint greater perſons to ouerlooke
you. He which ſéeketh to conquer another countrey will vſe
all wayes &amp; deuiſes to attaine his purpoſe.<note place="margin">Hiena. Eccleſ. cap. 13. Plin. hiſtor. natur. lib. 8. cap. 30. Crocodiles.</note> The beaſt <hi>Hiena</hi>

would like well of the change of religion, as well as the

then the Frenchmen began to ſhew their inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and hatred towards the Engliſhmen, and forgetting
all former promiſes (ſuch is the nature of ſtrangers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they

in ſpoiling &amp; robbing the people of that country without
pitie or mercie, and bare little good will towards the Engiſh
men, as it appeareth ſundry wayes: and firſt of all, in that they
had them in maner in no regard or eſtimation, but rather
ſought by all meanes to ſpoyle and kéepe them vnder,<note place="margin">Booke of Martyrs. fol. 257.</note> not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

at the firſt they vſed to do, neither did they procéede by their
directions in their buſineſſe, as before they were accuſtomed:
and thirdly, in all their conuerſation, neither <hi>Lewes</hi> nor his
Frenchmen vſed them ſo familiarly as at the firſt comming
they did, but ſhewed more loftie countenance towards them,
whereby they greatly encreaſed the indignation of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh

To conclude,<note place="margin">Holinſh. 602.</note> where great promiſes were made at their
entring into the land, they were ſlow enough in performing
the ſame: ſo as the expectation of the Engliſh Barons was
made quite voyd, for they perceiued daily, that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
and ſcoffed at for their diſloyalty ſhewed towards their
owne naturall Prince, hearing now and then nips &amp; taunts
openly by the Frenchmen, ſaying, that as they had ſhewed
themſelues falſe and vntruſtie to their owne lawfull king,<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſo
they would not continue anie long time true to a ſtranger.
Hereupon the Barons better conſidering the words of the
ſayd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icount of <hi>Melloit,</hi> and withall the great daunger
that the realme was brought in by their diſſention and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

they ioyned with the King in battell againſt <hi>Lewes,</hi> where

               <p>It is written of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Alexander.</note> who had conquered

ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> was conſtrained to flie, and came to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to
ſue for ayde at the hands of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the ſaid king

from whom,<note place="margin">The Prince of Wales his voyage into Spaine.</note> the ſaid Prince determined to bring home
the ſaid king <hi>Peter,</hi> and to reſtore him againe to his kingdom
by force of armes, maugre his enemies. The Prince indéed
was verie deſirous to take this enterpriſe vpon him, both of a
certaine pitifull affection, mouing him to relieue this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtate of king <hi>Peter,</hi> and alſo of an ardent deſire, which he
had to purchaſe a glorious fame through martial déeds &amp; noble
acts of chiualrie. Therefore hauing this occaſion to imploy
his time in ſuch exerciſes, and now commaunded thereto of
his Father, he was excéeding glad in his mind, and with all
the ſpéed that might be, made his prouiſion both of a ſufficient
armie of men of warre, and alſo of all other things neceſſarie
for the furniture of ſuch an enterpriſe, but firſt he tooke good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of king <hi>Peter</hi> for the paiment of the ſouldiers wages.<note place="margin">1367. The Prince ſetteth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Spaine.</note>
Thus when the Prince had taken order for his iourny in each
condition, as was thought behoofefull, he with the king of
<hi>Spaine</hi> in his companie, paſſed forth with an army of thirtie
thouſand men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henrie</hi> king of <hi>Spaine</hi> hauing knowledge that the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> was thus comming againſt him, to reſtore his brother
king <hi>Peter</hi> to his former degrée, aſſembled of the French and
of his owne people to the number of foureſcore &amp; ſeuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
or there about, of men of warre: wherof ſeuen thouſand
were horſemen. King <hi>Henrie</hi> ſent to the Prince an Herald of
armes with a letter,<note place="margin">The king of Spaine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Prince.</note> requiring to know of him, for what cauſe
he moued warre againſt him, ſith he had neuer offered him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch occaſion. The Prince diſpatched the Herald with an
anſwer to the Letter, containing in effect, that for great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
<pb facs="tcp:5439:52"/>
he had taken vpon him to aide the rightfull king
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> thaſed out of his realme by violent wrong: and that
if it might be, he would gladly make an agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwixt
them, but ſo algates, that king <hi>Henry</hi> of neceſſitie muſt then
forſake all the title of the kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which by no
rightful meanes he could enioy: and therfore if he refuſed thus
to do, he was for his part reſolued how to procéed. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald
departed with this anſwer, and came therewith to king
<hi>Henrie,</hi> and deliuered it vnto him, as then lodged with his
puiſſant armie at <hi>Nouarret,</hi> which he liked not: whereupon
both parties prepared themſelues to battell, and ioyned. The
battell was eagerly fought, &amp; the victorie fell to the Prince.
There were ſtaine of men of armes fiue hundred and thrée
ſcore,<note place="margin">The number ſlaine at this battell at Nouarret.</note> and of Commons about ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thouſand and fiue hundred
of the kings part, and of the Engliſh part there was ſlaine of
men of account, but verie few, viz. foure knights, two Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coynes,
one Almaine, and the fourth an Engliſhman, and of
other meane Souldiers not paſt foure hundred,<note place="margin">Froiſſard.</note> as <hi>Froiſſard</hi>
ſaith, but other affirme that there was ſlaine of the Princes

a truth, if the battel were fought ſo ſore &amp; fiercely, as <hi>Froiſſard</hi>
himſelfe doth make report.</p>
               <p>This battell was fought vpon a Saturday,<note place="margin">Caxton.</note> the third of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill,

of great account. After the battell King <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Burgis,</hi>

entred with many voluntarie Gentlemen, and they which
entred, were not aboue 1000 men which wanne the towne,

hauing a caſtle ſtrongly edified in the midſt thereof, and ſo
fortified and victualled, that it was thought impoſſible to haue
bene wonne without cannon ſhot, and the houſes were all of
